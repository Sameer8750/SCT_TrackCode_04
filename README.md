## 📊 Dataset Overview :

The Traffic Accidents dataset includes detailed information about traffic accidents, including the number of vehicles and casualties, accident conditions, and details about the casualties involved.

**Key Features of the Dataset:**

- Reference Number: Unique identifier for each accident.
- Grid Ref: Easting: The eastward component of the grid reference for the accident location.
- Grid Ref: Northing: The northward component of the grid reference for the accident location.
- Number of Vehicles: The number of vehicles involved in the accident.
- Number of Casualties: The number of casualties resulting from the accident.
- Accident Date: The date on which the accident occurred.
- Time (24hr): The time of the accident in 24-hour format.
- 1st Road Class: The classification of the road where the accident occurred.
- Road Surface: The condition of the road surface at the time of the accident.
- Lighting Conditions: The lighting conditions at the time of the accident.
- Weather Conditions: The weather conditions at the time of the accident.
- Casualty Class: The class/category of the casualty (e.g., pedestrian, driver).
- Casualty Severity: The severity of the casualty's injuries.
- Sex of Casualty: The gender of the casualty.
- Age of Casualty: The age of the casualty.
- Type of Vehicle: The type of vehicle involved in the accident.

## 🔍 Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

To prepare the dataset for analysis, several cleaning and preprocessing steps were performed:

- Handling missing values in relevant columns.
- Converting categorical variables such as 'Sex of Casualty' and 'Lighting Conditions' into numerical formats.
- Creating new features to enhance the dataset's analysis capability.

## 🧪 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA was conducted to uncover patterns and insights within the dataset:

- Accident Analysis: Analyzed overall accident rates and compared them across different road classes, lighting conditions, and weather conditions.
- Vehicle Involvement: Examined the distribution of the number of vehicles involved in accidents.
- Casualty Analysis: Investigated the severity of casualties and their distribution based on age and gender.
- Temporal Analysis: Explored the distribution of accidents over different times of the day and dates.
- Road and Weather Conditions: Studied the effect of road and weather conditions on accident rates.

## 🚀 Key Features

## 💡 Insights

- The majority of accidents involved 2-3 vehicles.
- Most accidents occurred under clear weather conditions.
- Casualties were predominantly of minor severity.
- Accidents were more frequent during the evening hours.
- The age group 20-40 had the highest number of casualties.
